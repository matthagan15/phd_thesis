\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {B.4}{\ignorespaces These plots show the distance to the target thermal state for Hydrogen 2 and Hydrogen 3 chains as the number of interactions $L$ increases. For both Hydrogen 2 and 3 we set $\beta = 4.0$, which gives a ground state overlap of greater than 0.5 for Hydrogen 2 and 0.25 for Hydrogen 3. $\gamma $ for both \ref {fig:h2_error} and \ref {fig:h3_error} was generated by placing a Gaussian at the average energy $\Tr \left [ H_S \right ] / \qopname \relax o{dim}_S$ with a width of $\left | \left | H_S \right | \right | / 2$. We note that a variety of $\setbox \z@ \hbox {\mathsurround \z@ $\textstyle \alpha $}\mathaccent "0365{\alpha }^2$ values were chosen to demonstrate the faster convergence, but higher error, of strong coupling. \relax }}{118}{figure.caption.15}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {B.5}{\ignorespaces In these plots the amount of total simulation time needed to prepare a $\beta = 2.0$ thermal state with $\alpha = 0.01$ and $t = 500$ is tracked as a function of the noise added to samples of $\gamma $. A sample for $\gamma $ is generated by choosing two non-equal eigenvalues from the system spectrum and adding a Gaussian random variable with standard deviation $\sigma $. For each value of $\sigma $ the resulting state needs to have an average trace distance of less than $0.05$ for 100 samples.\relax }}{119}{figure.caption.16}%
